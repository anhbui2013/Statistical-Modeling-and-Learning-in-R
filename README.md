# Statistical-Modeling-and-Learning-in-R
You’ve learned the basics of R, but now you need to know how to actually do your analysis. If that might include running some type of regression model, this is the workshop for you. Whether you want to use regression for statistical inference or prediction, this workshop will cover the basics to help you get started. Things you’ll learn in this workshop:

    Use R’s formula syntax to specify models
    Run common regression models in R
    Read model fit summaries and output
    Make predictions with regression models in R
    Basic model diagnostic tools

This workshop is a part of the Data Science and Programming Summer Workshop Series: https://sites.northwestern.edu/summerworkshops
